README: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Project Overview
This project focuses on performing customer segmentation for a retail chain using K-Means clustering. The dataset includes demographic and behavioral information such as region, age, income level, preferred product, and spending score. The objective is to identify distinct customer segments to support location-specific inventory planning and marketing strategies.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

Column Name	Description
Region	Geographical region of the customer (e.g., North)
Age	Age of the customer
IncomeLevel	Annual income of the customer
PreferredProduct	Product category the customer prefers
SpendingScore	A score assigned based on customer spending behavior

Objective
To apply K-Means clustering on customer data to group customers into segments. These segments can help the retail chain:
Understand regional preferences
Identify high-value customers
Optimize inventory planning by region

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

# Step 1: Load the dataset
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("retail_customer_data.csv")

# Step 2: Encode categorical features
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le_region = LabelEncoder()
le_product = LabelEncoder()
df["RegionEncoded"] = le_region.fit_transform(df["Region"])
df["ProductEncoded"] = le_product.fit_transform(df["PreferredProduct"])

# Step 3: Select features and apply KMeans
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
X = df[["Age", "IncomeLevel", "SpendingScore", "RegionEncoded", "ProductEncoded"]]
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df["Cluster"] = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Step 4: Visualize the clusters
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(df["IncomeLevel"], df["SpendingScore"], c=df["Cluster"], cmap="viridis", s=100)
plt.xlabel("Income Level")
plt.ylabel("Spending Score")
plt.title("Customer Segments")
plt.colorbar(label="Cluster")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()


Output
Customers are grouped into clusters based on spending behavior and preferences.

A 2D scatter plot displays customer segments based on income and spending score.

Use Cases
Regional marketing campaigns
Product placement and inventory decisions
Customer loyalty and engagement strategies
